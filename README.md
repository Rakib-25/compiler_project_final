# Mini Compiler Front-End

This project implements a mini compiler front-end for a simple custom programming language using Lex (Flex) and Yacc (Bison) in C.

The system performs lexical analysis and syntax parsing for structured programs and produces interpreted outputs based on recognized constructs.

It was developed as part of a Compiler Design course to demonstrate core concepts of language processing and parsing.

# Features

Header inclusion detection

Variable declaration and assignment

Arithmetic expression evaluation

Input and output operations

Loop handling (for, while)

Conditional execution (if–else)

User-defined function recognition

Comment detection

Syntax validation using grammar rules

# Implementation

Lexical analysis implemented using Flex

Parser and grammar rules implemented using Bison

Semantic actions written in C

Automated build process via Makefile

Key Files

fp.l — lexical rules

fp.y — grammar and parser definition

lex.yy.c, fp.tab.c — generated source files

Executables generated after compilation

# How It Works

The lexical analyzer scans the input program and generates tokens.

The parser validates syntax based on grammar rules.

Semantic actions execute recognized constructs.

The program outputs results and detected structures.

# Purpose

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of compiler construction, including tokenization, parsing, and grammar-driven language processing — foundational ideas relevant to NLP and language modeling research.
